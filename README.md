# React JS - NextJS Exercise 2

**Goal:** Learn how to implement data fetching and parallel with intercepting routes.

## Instructions ðŸ“–

1. Create a new NextJS project by running `npx create-next-app@latest`. You can call the project `nextjs-data-fetch`.
2. Create a Users page `/users` and display a list of user first names from `https://dummyjson.com/users`. Do not use a client component to fetch from the API.
3. Create a dynamic route (example `/users/5` where 5 represents an id) where it displays the specific user's firstName, lastName, age, gender, and email.
4. On the `/users` page, when you click on the first name, it should open a modal which displays only the user's id, firstName, and lastName. Use **Parallel** + **Intercepting** routes to create the modal.
5. The modal should have a **Close** or **Back** link which redirects to the `/users/` page.
6. Style your app using TailwindCSS so that it looks presentable.
7. Commit and push your changes.

Good luck! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
